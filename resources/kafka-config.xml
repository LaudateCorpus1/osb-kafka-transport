    <!-- Under normal circumstances, the option below would do the work of
         activating the endpoints only when the server be up-and-running.
         However, tests had shown that this option is not suitable for the
         Kafka Transport needs. In the particular case of Business Services
         which leverages tha Kafka Client Producer API - the background thread
         created internally to communicate with Kafka is not aware of Service
         Bus state, thus causing issues to establish the communication. -->
